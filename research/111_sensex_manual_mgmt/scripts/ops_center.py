     "2027-03-31", "SCHEDULED",
     "research/155 CONCLUDED: leave the IPO sleeve's idle cash in cash (5% p.a.). Arun's forward-visibility proposal was built and tested properly - 114 cells x 30 paired paths, every pull-back friction charged (25/40/60 bps both ways, tax on the realised gain with FY netting, T+1 settlement, pro-rata/LIFO/FIFO lot policy). The premise is CONFIRMED (25 bars plus a 25-day base make a 2-day-old listing ineligible for about five weeks, so the next 25 sessions are fully visible with NO look-ahead) and the mechanism WORKS (0 missed entries, about 30 pull-backs in 20 years) - but it can only touch 2.7% of the portfolio, because the sleeve is 20% of the blend, is 67.3% cash, and the candidate pool is empty on only 19.0% of days. It buys +0.105pp blend CAGR (30/30 paths) but only +0.006 Calmar (21/30) against a pre-registered bar of +0.10 on at least 26 of 30, and the advantage is gone by 40 bps and negative by 60. Continuous redeployment is worse: -0.375 Calmar on 30/30 and correlation to Open Alpha 0.21 -> 0.90. REVISIT ONLY IF (a) the IPO sleeve's blend weight exceeds 30%, or (b) the IPO pipeline has been in drought for more than 12 consecutive months. Then re-run research/155 phase 3b at the then-current weights; PASS = the gated arm clears +0.10 blend Calmar on at least 26 of 30 paired paths AND survives the 40 bps rung.

    ("research/154 six-sleeve blend - allocation decision (2 satellites) + the r/146-153 drawdown re-audit",
     "2026-10-15", "PENDING",
     "research/154 enumerated every combination of the six sleeves (OA, TN, VCP, MYB, IPO, GOLD) - 8,172 cells, all PAIRED across 360 paths (30 OA seeds x 12 TN rebalance-day offsets) - and produced three things Arun must act on. (1) A RETRACTION THAT COMES FIRST: the deployed TN+OA pair's worst drawdown in twenty years is the 2008 crash at -16.5% (monthly marks) / -17.15% (daily), NOT the -2.4% that research/146 and /151 reported. Those studies measured the 2008 window starting 2008-01-01, i.e. AFTER the December-2007 peak, so the drawdown from that peak was invisible. ACTION OWED AT THIS REVIEW: re-audit every per-window drawdown figure in research/146 through /153 for the same window-start artefact, and re-open the crash-alpha candidates that r/146 rejected on the (now false) basis that the pair has no crash tail. (2) THE ALLOCATION DECISION: 197 of 1,767 enumerated weight vectors clear the pre-registered bar on ALL THREE panels (median CAGR at least the pair's, and beating the pair, a cash null AND an IPO beta-matched null on >=288/360 paired paths each) - a broad CONTIGUOUS plateau, not a peak. With operational constraints applied (keep both live books, cap the never-traded sleeve at 20%, cap gold at 20%) the best vector is OA 40 / TN 25 / IPO 20 / GOLD 15 = 28.21% CAGR / -10.77% MaxDD / Calmar 2.61 against the deployed pair's 27.74% / -17.01% / 1.68 on 2006-04 to 2026-08, winning 360/360 paths against the pair, 360/360 against cash and 358/360 against the beta-matched null; its 2008 is +7.3% at a -7.5% drawdown. The DEPLOYABLE-TODAY step, using no unproven sleeve, is OA 60 / TN 15 / GOLD 25 = 28.02% / -13.31% / Calmar 2.095. NOTE research/147's 45/45/10 is NOT admitted - it fails CAGR-at-least-the-pair by 1.13pp on the 2006+ window; gold pays for its drawdown cut with return unless Open Alpha's weight rises to fund it. (3) TWO KILLS TO RECORD: VCP is Open Alpha (87.0% of OA's signals are VCP signals, 48.6% holding-day overlap, correlation 0.749) and MYB shares 90.2% of its signals with VCP - retire both permanently. IPO is the opposite: 0.0% signal AND 0.0% holding-day overlap with OA - not one shared symbol-day in sixteen years. PRE-CONDITION ON ANY IPO WEIGHT: it has never traded, live or paper, and it is invested only 19.6% of NAV (zero trades in 2013 and in 2014), so beyond about 20% weight its extra Calmar is indistinguishable from de-levering. The paper-soak criterion already registered under the research/153 review applies unchanged and must clear BEFORE any rupee. ALSO OWED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT: a quarterly-rebalance sensitivity, because blend-level rebalancing turnover and its tax are NOT modelled.
