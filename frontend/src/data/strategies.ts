This book was the only LIVE sleeve losing money: −₹10,089 at t −1.00 over 10 sessions, with all three live Mondays negative (−₹56,630 at 10-lot equivalent). research/138 shows the cause is WHICH DAYS it trades, not its parameters — no stop level rescues DTE1 (positive at all six levels tested but t only 1.0–1.6, roughly 4× DTE3\'s drawdown, and its replay edge is almost entirely in the first half of the sample: ₹1,31,845 → ₹12,960 across halves). The deeper reason: the 9:16 suite and this held-straddle/combined-stop mechanic have near-opposite weekday edges (suite t Mon 2.89 / Tue −0.24 / Thu −0.37; combined-stop t Mon 1.23 / Tue 1.85 / Thu 3.85), and the live config ran both on Mon+Tue — so COMB was piling correlated size onto the suite\'s single best day while sitting out the days it earns on. Thursday deliberately NOT promoted (Arun): DTE3 is the steadiest cell in the grid and is stop-invariant from SL20 upward (0/18 stops fired), but NIFTY came off Thursdays on 27-Aug for SENSEX-expiry margin and that stands — it keeps accumulating paper Thursdays for the 2026-10-30 ops review.
