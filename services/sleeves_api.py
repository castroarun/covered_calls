"""
Capital Desk API — Flask blueprint. Every rupee in or out of every book goes here.

Contract, uniform across books: POST {"amount": N, "dry_run": true} returns a PLAN and
mutates nothing; dry_run false executes. Positions are never force-sold — a withdrawal
that cannot be funded from cash (plus the CASHIETF sweep, on True North) is refused with
409 and a plan showing what would have to be sold. Every executed flow is ledgered.

Each leg dispatches to the BOOK'S OWN hardened implementation rather than reimplementing
it here:

  truenorth  -> momentum_paper.cash_deposit / cash_withdraw
                (deploy plan, CASHIETF unsweep before selling, weakest-momentum-first,
                 mp_fills audit rows, capital fence, fund-flow ledger)
  openalpha  -> oa_real.deposit / withdraw
                (capital ledger + lockfile; alert-and-ledger only, since the real book
                 has no automated executor — it records the money and tells Arun what to
                 buy, it never places an order)

Rewritten 05-Sep-2026. What this file used to claim, and what it actually did:

  - the docstring said the True North leg "calls the existing /api/momentum-paper/
    deposit|withdraw"; it did not — it did raw INSERT OR REPLACE on mp_state, skipping
    the deploy plan, the unsweep, the weakest-first sell and the audit trail (D3), which
    is why the same Rs 1L withdrawal 409'd here and executed on the True North page (D4)
  - the Open Alpha endpoints edited bluesky_paper_state.json, the RETIRED paper book,
    while the real money book had no capital concept and no route at all (D1)

  GET  /api/sleeves/status                 (all books + allocation drift)
  POST /api/sleeves/{truenorth,openalpha}/{deposit,withdraw}  {"amount": N, "dry_run": bool}
  GET  /api/sleeves/allocation             (targets, current weights, drift, gaps)
  POST /api/sleeves/allocation/route       {"amount": N} -> where a deposit should go
  POST /api/sleeves/allocation/targets     {"targets": {...}, "note": str}
  GET  /api/sleeves/dividends              (policy state + ledger, both books)
  POST /api/sleeves/dividends/preview      (dry-run declaration, both books)

No trading logic is touched here: no entry, exit, stop, trail, sizing, gate or selection
rule. This module moves money and reports; the engines decide what to do with it.

#
#   D1  Every /api/sleeves/openalpha/* call used to mutate bluesky_paper_state.json —
#       the RETIRED paper book — while the real money book (oa_real_state.json,
#       Rs 4.46L) had no capital concept and no route at all. Real capital was
#       untracked and unwithdrawable. OA now dispatches to services.oa_real.
#   D3  The True North leg used to do raw INSERT OR REPLACE on mp_state, bypassing
#       cash_deposit()/cash_withdraw() — so no deploy plan, no CASHIETF unsweep, no
#       weakest-first sell, no mp_fills audit row, no capital fence. Two docstrings
#       and the UI both claimed the opposite. It now calls the real functions.
#   D4  Consequence of D3: the same Rs 1L withdrawal 409'd here and executed on the
#       True North page, because this leg capped at ledger cash and never unswept the
#       Rs 3.3L sitting in CASHIETF. Fixed by D3.
#
# The paper Open Alpha book stays running as the reference model; it simply no longer
# takes money. Its notional capital is fixed by the study spec.

    (06-Sep-2026): **the first real deposit through this desk arms it for real money.**
    Paper is the state it waits in, not a state it has to be argued out of.

    What arming does and does not mean, stated plainly because the difference matters:

      does      flips `ipo_status` to 'live', sets the sleeve's real capital, and makes

                so a live IPO sleeve alerts with the exact buy or sell and Arun places
                it. Claiming otherwise would be the dangerous kind of wrong.

    Withdrawing everything does NOT put the sleeve back on paper. Going live is a
    decision about the strategy, not about today's balance, and silently un-arming a
    book because it briefly held no cash is exactly the sort of state change nobody
